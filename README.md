### JS Week 3 Code Review - Epicodus

# You-Zoo

### Author: Colin Worf

## Description

This project is a result of our first look at angular. I used the Angular CLI to set up this project/.

Users can add animals to a zoo roster as well as edit.

Users can filter results live by clicking one of the three age filters on top.

I tried my hand at an "edit in place" option where each field would be editable separately, however I got in over my head a bit and backed down to the edit form taking the place of the element being edited.

If I had more time for this one I would have worked more on the edit in place option, as well as some category separation in the initial sort.

## Instructions

1. Clone project ```$ git clone https://github.com/cworf/YouZoo.git ```
2. you must have Node.js, and angular-cli to build out this project
3. from the projects root, run ```$ npm i```
4. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` or use `ng serve --open`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
